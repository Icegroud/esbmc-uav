# esbmc-uav

Based on ESBMC V6.8.0, the project optimizes part of the underlying code in PX4 V1.12.3 and ArduPilot V3.7.0 so that ESBMC can formalize security verification.

In order to implement this project, you first need to become familiar with the formal validation tool ESBMC.

Then use the core code of the script to build a new script that fits your experimental environment, process the source code files in the Object folder, and finally complete the validation.
